# Secret-message-encrypt-and-decrypt-using-python
This Python project provides a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for text encryption and decryption using the Tkinter library. The application allows users to securely encrypt and decrypt text messages using a secret key.

Encryption is the process of translating plain text data (plaintext) into something that appears to be random and meaningless (ciphertext). It provides us high security and privacy on our chat/ messages ,or in sharing any confidential data on any social media .

Decryption is a process of converting encrypted text back to normal text. So the people have this software and password, can ready it easily.

Text Encryption: Convert plaintext messages into encrypted format.

Text Decryption: Convert encrypted messages back to plaintext.

Password Protection: Ensure only authorized users can encrypt and decrypt messages.

User-Friendly GUI: Intuitive interface for easy interaction.
